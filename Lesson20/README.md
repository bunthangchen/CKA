# SSL/TLS Explained Simply

## SSL: Secure Sockets Layer
SSL is standard technology for securing an internet connection by encrypting data sent between a website and a browser (or between two servers). It prevents hackers from seeing or stealing any information transferred, including personal or financial data.

## TLS: Transport Layer Security
TLS is an updated, more secure version of SSL.

## HTTPS: Hyper Text Protocol Secure
HTTPS appears in the URL when a website is secured by an SSL/TLS certificate. Users can view the details of the certificate, including the issuing authority and the corporate name of the website owner, by clicking the lock symbol on the browser bar.
